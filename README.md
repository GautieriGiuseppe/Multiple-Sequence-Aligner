# Multiple-Sequence-Aligner
The scripts performs the MSA of sequences starting from a list of FASTA files.
The v1 and v2 makes usage of the external tool ClustalW and MUSCLE in order to obtain the alignment.

The built-in version performs the same operation using the same algorithm of ClustalW but without the tools, computing it through Pandas and Numpy.
